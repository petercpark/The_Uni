## Product
If you are going DIY with this, here are the materials you need:
* The Uni PCB x 1 (diodes will come pre-assembled)
* Arduino Pro Micro x 1
* Switches x 28
* Keycaps x 28
* Willingness to solder x 1

If you want me to assemble here are the materials you need:
* money (I don't know how much yet but it will be less expensive than the Georgi for sure)

## Arduino
The arduino you should use is the Pro Micro. You can also use other microcontrollers with same footprints such as the Elite C. I will be providing the Pro Micro on the assembled board.

## Switches
Nearly any switch is compatible. The board has a footprint that accomodates for mx, alps, and choc style switches. The assembled board will come with Gateron Clear switches (35 grams).

## Keycaps
I recommend 3d printing your caps, if you don't have a 3d printer, you can buy some from me (sometime in the future when my store is up). There are flat keycaps for mx style switches at pimpmykeyboard.com called f10 keycaps. There is also a slightly less flatter version called the G20 keycap and the Stenomod uses this as its keycaps. These are extremely expensive though. The assembled version will come with 3d printed keycaps.

## Soldering
All you have to solder are the switches, if you get the assembled version, I will do this for you.
