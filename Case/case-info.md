# Important Things to Note When Printing Your Case

- you probably want to 3d print these. Don't try to get it laser cut unless you know what you are doing because the size will not fit if you try laser printing.
- Regular 1.00 scale WILL NOT FIT. Scale up the model in your slicer to 1.005 or 1.01 to have it fit.
- If you just want to test print the fit, sink the model in your slicer so that the bottom layer is not printed. This will allow you to test how tight the border will fit before you print the case including the entire base. This can save time and filament.
- I used SUNLU PLA
- print with a bigger nozzle if you have one. Use a 0.3mm layer height for a 0.4mm nozzle for the fastest turnout.
- I used a 1mm nozzle at 0.8mm layer height, but for a big nozzle like this, I used a much higher temperatures (240C) and a much slower speed (25mm/s). This takes about an hour.
- If your printer is too small, use the files from the split folder.
- If your print came out too tight, you can always sand the walls of the case to make the opening a bit wider.

# What NOT to do

- Don't print at 1.00 scale. The STL file is made using the measurements from the kicad pcb files, so it will not fit AT ALL.
